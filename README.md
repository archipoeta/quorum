#Quorum
A Meeting/Voting/Quorum add-on for ESO (The Elder Scrolls Online)

###Usage:

As ESO Add-Ons are not permitted to post directly to chat channels for security reasons,
instead, this add-on populates the chat input with all the correct info.

After clicking a button in the Quorum add-on, you need only press "Enter,Enter" (enter twice) to send the appropriate message to the appropriate channel.

- Beyond the above, you do not need to activate or otherwise concern yourself with the chat input with regard to this add-on.
- Guild Leaders/Officers will be presented with options to Chair meetings.
- Active and Numbered Guild Commands provided for ease of use.

### Main Addon Commands:

    /quo
        Toggle Add-On visibility

### Active Quorum Guild Commands

    /ginvite [character_name]

    /grecruit [message]
        Set or populate chat input with the recruiting message for Active Guild.
